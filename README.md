# Report-Term-Highlighter
A Google Docs automation tool that uses JavaScript to automatically identify and highlight specified unwanted terms or phrases within documents. This script streamlines the report review process by visually marking terms that need correction or removal, making document editing more efficient and consistent.

## How to use
1. Copy and paste the code into the Apps Script section on your Google Docs. 
2. Notice that there will be a new custom menu button called 'Highlight US English and Other Terms', click on it and select 'Highlight Terms'
3. The script would then detect and highlight US English and several other terms specified in the script.
4. Modifications:
 * If you want to add or modify terms in the script, locate the word and remove/modify it
 * You can also change the desired highlight colour instead of #ff000d (red colour)
